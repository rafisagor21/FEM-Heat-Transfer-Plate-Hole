# Finite Element Analysis of a Plate with a Circular Discontinuity

**Course:** MEEN 672 - Finite Element Methods
**Language:** Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
**Method:** Galerkin Method with Linear Triangular (T3) Elements

## Project Overview
This repository contains a custom Finite Element Method (FEM) solver developed to analyze steady-state heat transfer. The project focuses on the implementation of an **Structured Radial Mesh** (O-Grid topology) to accurately capture thermal gradients near a circular boundary without the use of commercial meshing software.
